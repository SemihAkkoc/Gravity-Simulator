# Gravity-Simulator

In this programme we tried to simulate the Newton's law of universal gravitation, which is:

            <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?F=G{\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}}" title="F=G{\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}}" />

We generate n number of point masses around a circle with given initial velocity then render the enviorment.

Nothing is perfect but with [Ulaş Dilek](https://github.com/ulasdilek) we can get really close to perfect.
